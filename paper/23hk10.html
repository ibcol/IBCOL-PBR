To address these concerns and ensure a smooth and trustworthy recruitment process, we propose an enterprise software solution — a current working project named Digital Trusted Transcripts (DTT). DTT enables students to manage their academic and extracurricular achievements in a portable and paperless manner. It also allows students to provide authentic information to any verifier at any time, ensuring the information is as trusted as if it was provided directly from the source.</p><p>DTT handles various documents, including academic transcripts from home institutions, academic transcripts from exchange institutions, and records of extracurricular activities within and outside of academic institutions.</p><p>The key features include digital dossier (i.e. application for holding transcripts and records from Level 1 to 4), record retrieval app (to request Level 4 records from golden source and to mint Level 3 records through web authentication), record creation app (for golden source issuers to issue Level 4 records), record minting engine (for creating Level 3 records), and inspection app (for validating, authenticating, and verifying records from Level 1 to 4).</p><p>Level 1: declaration only<br>Level 2: declaration with unverifiable, unauthenticated, and hopefully valid supporting documents<br>Level 3: authenticated records<br>Level 4: verifiable records</p><p>The solution incorporates an efficient verification process. By leveraging the transparency and traceability features of blockchain, stakeholders can easily verify the extracurricular involvement of candidates. This streamlined verification process, which is consent-based and timely, saves time and effort, benefiting both recruiters and applicants. It preserves trust and transparency, making it more efficient than current paper-centric or spreadsheet-based practices.</p><p>Furthermore, the recruiting side needs to gain access to a candidate’s data with their consent. Candidates may only submit materials related to the recruiting process. Selective and partial disclosure is possible with privacy-enhancing tech like zero-knowledge proofs. This selective transparency facilitates informed decision-making for the recruiting side by providing relevant materials while maintaining a level of privacy for candidates.</p><p>With the background check completed in the first step, the selection process can be automated with smart contracts. Recruiters can program the contracts to automatically categorize candidates into different groups based on educational background, experience level, or specific skills. This saves time and effort in matching candidates with job requirements, allowing recruiters to filter out unqualified candidates and focus on accessing a list of targeted candidates.</p><p>To successfully implement this solution, collaboration across institutions and non-institutions is crucial. This facilitates data sharing and interoperability, which are the foundations of innovation and knowledge sharing. By having a network built on trust, student societies, education institutions, and various stakeholders can create an effective recruitment process aligned with their interests.</p><p>Since City University of Hong Kong (CityU) is known for its strong connections with various educational institutions and companies, offering many placement and internship opportunities for students. These connections cover different sectors and industries, allowing students to acquire practical experience and industry insights, which improve their employability after graduation. Furthermore, CityU provides a variety of student services, such as residence halls and sports teams. These connections and services are part of CityU’s holistic education approach, which aims to prepare students with the skills and knowledge they need for their future careers. By understanding these aspects, we can improve our product to suit the needs of CityU students, increasing its effectiveness and relevance. This could involve customizing features to help students access these opportunities and services, or linking with CityU’s existing systems to provide a smooth user experience. Ultimately, our goal is to create a product that adds value to the students’ educational experience at CityU.</p><p>In conclusion, our blockchain-based solution for managing extracurricular transcripts in student societies offers significant benefits for the recruiting process. With secure record storage, efficient verification, transparent transaction records, and the exploration of smart contract implementation, the solution ensures due diligence and enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of recruiting practices. As the recruiting landscape continues to evolve, this blockchain-enabled approach presents a promising solution to address the challenges of secure and transparent recruiting.</p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" onclick="passURL">Request Download</button></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="page-footer dark"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col col-sm-9 col-9 col-lg-9 col-xl-9 xol-xxl-9"><h5>Practical Blockchain Review (PBR)</h5><p style="color: white;">Practical Blockchain Review (PBR) is an archive intended for an audience of esoteric knowledge seekers, such as those from academic institutions, researchers, and niche practitioners.
